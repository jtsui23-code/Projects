Character

Description:
    This class represents a character in a game, providing functionality for movement, 
    collision detection, and rendering. It is designed to be flexible, supporting both 
    player and non-player characters (NPCs) in a top-down game. It interacts with a tilemap 
    for collision resolution and can render its position relative to a camera offset.

Public Methods:
    - __init__(game, eType, pos, size)           Initializes the character with its type, position, size, and other 
                                                 properties needed for movement and collision handling.
    - rect()                                     Returns a pygame.Rect object representing the character's current position 
                                                 and size for collision detection.
    - update(tilemap, movement=(0, 0))          Updates the character's position based on movement and resolves collisions 
                                                 with tiles in the provided tilemap.
    - render(surf, offset=(0, 0))               Renders the character's sprite on a given surface, accounting for camera offset.
    - speedUp(speed=1)                          Increases the character's speed by a multiplier.

Usage:
    - Instantiate the Character class: character = Character(game_instance, 'player', (x, y), (width, height))
    - Update movement and collision: character.update(tilemap_instance, movement=(x_movement, y_movement))
    - Render the character: character.render(surface, offset=(camera_x, camera_y))
    - Adjust speed: character.speedUp(1.5)  # Example multiplier
