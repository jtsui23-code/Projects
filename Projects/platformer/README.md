## Platformer Using Pygame

### Description:
This program displays a Pygame platformer game. To move the character, use WASD or arrow keys. If the user presses space then the character dashes and can defeat enemies through dashing into them. When all enemies are defeated then the player transitions to the next level. Once the player has passed the third level, then the player has won the game.
