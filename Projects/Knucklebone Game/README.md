## 10-P03 - Knucklebone Game In SFML
### Jack Tsui
### Description:
This program displays a Knucklebone game window using the SFML library. Both players are prompted to enter their names.
Once both names are entered, the window transitions from the title screen to the game screen with two boards. 
To roll, the player must press space on their respective turn. Then place their dice number on their grid which is labeled with their name. 
Once one of the two grids is filled, the winner is displayed. Players can destroy enemy columns if they place a dice number 
on the same column as their opponent with the same dice number. Example: If player1 rolls a 5 and places it on column 2 
and player2 has a 5 on any cell on their own column 2, then they lose that cell number with a 5 in it.
